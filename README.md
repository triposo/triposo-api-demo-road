# triposo-api-demo-citywalk
The source code for the Road (trip) demo

## SETUP
- npm install
- rename SAMPLE.env to .env and edit the file
- npm start
- go nuts

## NOTES
This demo only works in developer mode, to build a production version you need to
move your Triposo API calls to the server side.
We are working on a solution for providing client side calls.
